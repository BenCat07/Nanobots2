Nanobots:

* Early version of ghost building construction bots. Allows researching automated construction earlier (for blueprints etc)
* Equip the Nano Emitter and Some Nano ammo and make it your selected gun and any ghosts/blueprints within 7.5 tiles of you will be automatically built if you have the items in your inventory.
* These early version bots are only capable of building and do not replenish (each Ammo magazine will build 20 items)
* Nanobots do not work inside logistic networks.
* Shooting the ammo currently does nothing but waste nano bots. Don't shoot the ammo :)

Late Game Additions:

* Adds to new equipment pieces for your armor that enhance your personal roboport.
* The Item Programmer will mark all items-on-ground (artifacts, etc) in your robo construction range for deconstruction as long as no enemies are around.
* The Tree Programmer will mark all trees within 10 * (Number of equipped programmers) tiles from you for deconstruction.
