# NANOBOTS
#### Robot enhancements from the start of the game.
Learn how to create powerfull but consumable robots after learning automation. Get up and running fast by using these robots to help you build your way up to Roboports and even smarter robots. Add modules to your power armor to reprogram your personal roboport to complete mundane tasks automatically. Place roboport interfaces to have your logistic networks perform tasks while you are away.

#### Nanobots:
-   Pre bot version of ghost building construction bots. Allows researching automated construction earlier (for blueprints etc).
-   Equip the Nano Emitter and some Nano ammo, make it your selected gun and any ghosts/blueprints within 7.5 tiles of you will be automatically built if you have the items in your inventory.
-   Technologies exist to slightly increase the range and speed of your nanobots.
-   These earlier version bots are capable of building, deconstructing and healing. They do not replenish (each Ammo magazine will build 10 items)
-   Nanobots do not work inside logistic networks, or personal roboport zones without an interface module installed in your power armor.
-   Manually shooting nanobots releases a pretty cloud of nanobots and nothing else. This is a good way to waste nanobots.

#### Ammo Details:
-   Nano Constructors - These nanobots will revive ghosts in their range, heal damaged structures, and deconstruct marked items.
-   Nano Termites - These nanobots will kill off trees. This process causes the tree to topple over and may damage nearby structures.

#### Modular Armor Equipment:

Reprogram your personal roboport to do a lot of the mundane tasks for you. Most modules require an active personal roboport and construction bots to fully work.
-   Adds new equipment pieces for your power armor that will enhance your late game experience.
-   The item retriever module will mark all items on the ground (artifacts, etc) in your personal roboport construction range for deconstruction as long as no enemies are around.
-   The tree cutter module will mark all trees within your personal roboport range for deconstruction.
-   The unit launcher module will launch Destroys/Defenders/Distractors when enemies get inside your roborport range.
-   The feeder will automaticly heal you when you are low on health. For a bigger healing bonus keep a stack of healing capsules in your inventory.
-   The Nano interface will allow your nanobots to work even while you are inside logistic networks.

Hotkeys are available to toggle equipment on or off. Personal Roboports, Exoskeletons, Nightvision, All or individual Nanobot equipment modules.
If a piece of equipment in your armor is not enabled, adding more pieces of that equipment will install the disabled version.
Equipment states will stay with the power armor making it easy to swap out power armors without having to remember to also toggle the equipment.
